1
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,490
Ah! Fuck. Yeah, it doesn't matter.

2
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,270
Whoa. You okay there, Richard?

3
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,800
Uh, yeah, I'm fine.

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,000
Sorry, I can't really throw it any slower.

5
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,410
Give it another cut, Richard.

6
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,310
No, I'm fine. I don't want to.

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,640
Maybe someone else wants to. Who's next?

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,650
If someone has to go, I'll go,
but it seems very frightening.

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,680
You sure? You got us for the whole hour.

10
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:34,080
- Anyone?
- Would it hurt your feelings if no one went?

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,150
Man on P.A.: Ladies and gentlemen,

12
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,420
welcome to the annual
Stern-Taylor fall classic.

13
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:44,680
I'd like to start by making a toast
to our very special guest tonight,

14
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,550
Richard Hendricks.

15
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,650
Richard, after your perfect game

16
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,320
at TechCrunch Disrupt a few weeks ago,

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,460
we fell in love with you and your tech.

18
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,920
Look, we know everyone in
the Valley is after you,

19
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:59,870
and we know that you're probably
going to go with Peter Gregory,

20
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,800
but we'd love to have you
come play on our team.

21
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,640
Let Stern-Taylor Capital Fund
in on your Series A financing,

22
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,680
because together, Richard, we'd be...

23
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,980
a home... run!

24
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,520
- Oh, right.
- What do you say, Richard?

25
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:21,960
I'll... I'll do what I can.

26
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,490
All right.

27
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,030
Have fun, everybody.

28
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,330
I don't know, man. It's
starting to feel weird

29
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,560
letting all these firms suck up to us, even
though we're not gonna take their money.

30
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,660
Richard, Peter Gregory hasn't
officially given us the term sheet yet.

31
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,730
Yes, but he will tomorrow when he gets back.

32
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,860
If you can't enjoy this many people

33
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,770
kissing our ass at this level,

34
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,400
then I feel sorry for you.

35
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:48,570
Would you just relax and
take it in for a second?

36
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,070
I mean, we are getting our
dicks sucked at the AT&T Park.

37
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,480
We're standing on the field
of the World Series champions.

38
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:00,410
- It's totally lost on me.
- Yeah, I don't give a shit, either.

39
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,320
Hey! I'm Nicole Stein.

40
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,350
I lead the Growth Team at Stern-Taylor.

41
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,050
- Oh, I'm Dinesh.
- I'm Gilfoyle.

42
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:11,220
I love it. So what do
you two do at Pied Piper?

43
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:15,000
- I'm the CTO.
- Ha ha, he's joking. I'm the CTO.

44
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,890
Fuck you, I'm joking.

45
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,390
Okay, how could you be the
Chief Technology Officer?

46
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,700
I get it. You hear the word "chief,"
and you think "Indian Chief."

47
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,030
- but you're the other kind of Indian.
- Okay. One, Fuck you.

48
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:30,530
I'm Pakistani. And two, how
could you be CTO of anything?

49
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,270
You have to be able to organize, you have to
be able to delegate, and you have to be...

50
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:37,710
I delegate you to go get me a
fucking beer while I talk to Nicole.

51
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,150
George Silver, operating
partner at Stern-Taylor.

52
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,690
So, what do you do at Pied Piper?

53
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,190
He's the CTO.

54
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:54,630
That's Drew Houston. We've been circling
each other for the last 20 minutes.

55
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,800
Ooh, the Winklevoss twins.

56
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:00,440
Look at them. They're like two
genetically enhanced Ken dolls.

57
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,970
Do you know how much bitcoin they're worth?

58
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,370
Oh, shit, they're splitting up.

59
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,480
Cameron's the left dominant one, right?

60
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,680
- I can't tell them apart.
- I'm gonna come at him from the right side,

61
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,810
try and herd them back
together without spooking them.

62
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:16,280
Watch this. Cameron! Cameron!

63
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:21,080
- Okay.
- Well, well, well, look who's the big swinging dick.

64
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,950
Hey, Javeed, everything okay at Goolybib?

65
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,790
You gotta ask them. They canned me.

66
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:30,350
- What?
- Yeah, our investors got spooked

67
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,520
by a possible down round, so they
shoved an acquisition down my throat.

68
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,920
Yeah, an acquisition of $200 million, right?

69
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,960
Yeah, they all made out. I had
a reverse vest with no triggers,

70
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:44,490
then I lost all my shares when they fired me.

71
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,960
I blew my whole signing
bonus renting that house.

72
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,960
I'm looking into suing 'em.

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,200
- Jeez.
- Look, all I can say is,

74
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,910
don't get fucked, all right?

75
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,570
You take money from the wrong dudes,

76
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,600
and you'll get smoked as bad as I did.

77
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,860
Just be careful. Everyone
is watching you now.

78
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:04,700
Yeah. Totally. I know. Thanks, Javeed.

79
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:09,340
No, I mean they're watching you right now.

80
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,940
Oh yeah.

81
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,910
Damn it. Where is that camera?

83
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,700
Dinesh: I can't believe how
many gifts we're getting.

84
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:29,870
Gilfoyle: Gifts I'm getting.

85
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,240
That Oculus rig is addressed to the CTO.

86
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,770
No, I'm the CTO.

87
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,940
As your superior, I order
you to give me that Oculus.

88
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,650
You can't make me do stuff.
You're not the boss of me.

89
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,610
- Actually, I am the boss of you.
- Okay.

90
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,850
- Richard, tell him I'm CTO.
- Dinesh: You already told that fat guy that I'm the CTO.

91
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:47,460
Stop, stop, stop. Please stop.

92
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,390
I have a ton of work to
do. You have work to do.

93
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,860
Maybe let's do the work instead of that.

94
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,400
Jared, we were supposed
to get a term sheet today.

95
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,800
Have we heard from Peter Gregory?

96
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,370
- Peter Gregory is dead.
- What?

97
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,240
Holy shit.

98
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:23,720
He was the smartest, shrewdest...

99
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:27,230
strangest man I've ever known.

100
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,960
I can't believe that he's gone.

101
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,830
Can I asked what happened?

102
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,970
Yeah. He was...

103
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,040
in the Serengeti on safari...

104
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,670
- Ah.
- and he had just gone into his tent

105
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,540
when a hippo wandered into the camp.

106
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,880
Oh, wow.

107
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:49,680
He was attacked by a hippo?

108
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:54,480
No, I guess the hippo started to charge

109
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,950
when the guide grabbed his
rifle and shot at it, but...

110
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:01,960
his aim was off, and...

111
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,660
And he shot Peter Gregory by accident?

112
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,300
- Yeah.
- No, he... he missed...

113
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:14,340
but I guess the sound of the
gun startled Peter, who...

114
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:18,110
ran out of his tent and...

115
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,710
Ran right into the hippo?

116
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:24,380
No, the hippo was also startled by the noise

117
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:28,750
and had run off prior to
Peter exiting his tent.

118
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,490
So, what happened to Peter?

119
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:39,460
He hadn't run in a long time,

120
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:44,270
maybe ever, and you know, he just...

121
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,730
That was it.

122
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:58,840
- Oh, that is so...
- very strange.

123
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,210
- Very sad and tragic.
- Very sad and strange.

124
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,080
Richard: Wow.

125
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,930
See ya.

126
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,090
Man, that is so weird. I mean,
one minute Peter Gregory is here,

127
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,960
- the next, he's just gone.
- Jared, it's Erlich.

128
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,260
I need you to set up all
the other VC meetings, ASAP.

129
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,830
Line 'em up nuts to butts.

130
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,730
What are you doing? Monica just
said they're still gonna fund us.

131
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,230
- We should just sit tight.
- Look, I loved Peter Gregory

132
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,270
maybe even more than he loved me,

133
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,170
but there's something you need to know here,

134
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,180
something that Monica isn't
exactly volunteering up,

135
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,840
and that's all of these one-man
firms have a key man clause.

136
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,480
- Do you know what that means?
- No.

137
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,940
It means that now that Peter Gregory is gone,

138
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:40,220
all the Raviga investors have the
contractual right to cash out and walk away,

139
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,390
which means that by the end of the
day, there may not be a Raviga.

140
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,490
- Seriously?
- Yes, so we have to prepare for that.

141
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:49,760
Now, I know that it makes me
sound like a terrible person,

142
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,430
but we have a company to
run. And do you know who

143
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,170
the first person to agree with me would be?

144
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,670
Peter Gregory.

145
00:07:56,413 --> 00:08:03,128
_

146
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,050
Woman: And that is the very first spot

147
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,580
in our new campaign heralding
the upcoming release

148
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,150
of Nucleus this January at CES.

149
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,580
- Any questions?
- I have a question.

150
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,420
That was horrible. I just got
humiliated by a fucking teenager

151
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:21,960
at TechCrunch Disrupt, and
you give me this tampon ad?

152
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:25,630
- A girl with diabetes on a swing?
- I think she has cancer.

153
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,730
At least that's how I read it.

154
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,590
I don't care what kind of disease she had!

155
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:33,830
All I care about is that Nucleus
is better than Pied Piper.

156
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:36,000
Hendricks just left us all in the dust.

157
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:40,540
If we get this wrong, we could blow
the business opportunity of a lifetime!

158
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:43,210
Data creation is exploding.

159
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,680
With all the selfies and useless files

160
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:48,450
people refuse to delete on the cloud,

161
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,950
92% of the world's data

162
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,750
was created in the last two years alone.

163
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:56,630
At the current rate, the
world's data storage capacity

164
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,020
will be overtaken by next spring.

165
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,020
It will be nothing short of a catastrophe.

166
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:05,700
Data shortages, data
rationing, data black markets.

167
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:09,070
Someone's compression will save
the world from data-geddon,

168
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:13,370
and it sure as hell better be
Nucleus and not goddamn Pied Piper!

169
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:16,010
I don't know about you people,

170
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,450
but I don't wanna live in
a world where someone else

171
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,180
makes the world a better
place better than we do.

172
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,930
"Data-geddon." Is he married to that, or...?

173
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,060
There's just been a lot of "geddons" lately.

174
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:36,240
That's true. "Snow-mageddon," "Car-mageddon."

175
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,340
There's that movie "Armageddon."

176
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,480
Laurie, you wanted to see me?

177
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,790
Monica, come in, come in.
I'm sure you've heard by now

178
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,520
that I've been named our
new managing partner.

179
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,430
Yes. Congratulations.

180
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,920
Did the limited partners tell
you how they made their decision?

181
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,230
Oh, they looked at the portfolio performances

182
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,700
of each of the senior partners
over the last several funds,

183
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,930
and my numbers were,
objectively, the most favorable.

184
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:06,240
- Therefore, I was selected.
- Yeah, it's just managing partner

185
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:10,810
is all about meeting with people
and interacting with people.

186
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,580
You can sit down if you
want to. Do you want to?

187
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:13,980
- Oh.
- Or should we stand?

188
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:16,580
Uh, I... whatever... I'm standing...

189
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,190
- Okay.
- But you don't have to.

190
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,290
- Okay.
- Would it make you feel awkward to sit?

191
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,530
I'm okay to stand.

192
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,200
Monica... Of course.

193
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,270
Peter Gregory is dead.

194
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:31,940
Yes, I know.

195
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:36,080
On a personal note, his death is very sad.

196
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,950
But on a professional level, it's untenable.

197
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,280
I've been reviewing his files.

198
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,910
He was pursuing a number of
extremely dubious positions.

199
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:47,820
Are you aware that we own a $30
million ostrich farm in Morocco,

200
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,130
or that we are the majority stakeholders

201
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,470
in three companies that
specialize in invisibility?

202
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:57,110
This box is filled with
napkins covered with notes

203
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:01,110
detailing Peter's conviction that
genetically-modified cranberry fungus

204
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:04,890
- would become the next cotton.
- That... That one I remember, yes.

205
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,590
- Monica.
- Mm-hmm.

206
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,920
Peter Gregory is dead.

207
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,489
- Yes.
- We need to seem competitive,

208
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:16,890
now more than ever, to our investors
as well as to the industry at large.

209
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:22,110
Well, I mean, Pied Piper is probably the
hottest early investment in town right now,

210
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,180
- and we have them.
- Do we?

211
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:28,010
But why then are they speaking to other firms

212
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,280
- about investing in their Series A?
- No, no, I just told them

213
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,850
to sit tight for a day or two
until we sorted things out.

214
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:38,160
It seems that that advanced
a sense of uncertainty,

215
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,290
and now we're at risk of losing their round.

216
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:42,900
This could jeopardize the firm

217
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:47,270
and, by extension, your career here,
Monica, as an associate partner.

218
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:51,140
- Well, I guess I was just kind of in shock.
- Monica...

219
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,010
Peter Gregory is dead.

220
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:01,720
Yes. I know.

221
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,990
This is great.

222
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,820
Do you know how many times
I've gone into these rooms

223
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:09,490
with nothing but a half of an ass in my hand?

224
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:15,630
We're walking in there with three-foot
cocks covered in Elvis dust.

225
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,130
- Really?
- Richard Hendricks? They're ready for you.

226
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:21,540
- This is a fucking layup, guys.
- Okay, let's do this.

227
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,510
Not you, Jared.

228
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:29,410
Now, with proper funding, we
should be able to put together

229
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:32,050
a functioning beta in time for CES

230
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:36,550
and compress Nucleus out of the marketplace.

231
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,530
Yeah.

232
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,930
I don't know.

233
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,630
You don't... What?

234
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,630
It just doesn't seem worked out to me.

235
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:53,370
Well, I mean, it was worked out
enough to win TechCrunch Disrupt.

236
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:56,170
Yes, and congratulations, you won 50 grand,

237
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:59,480
but you're asking us for 200 times that.

238
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:02,810
Richard, look, we all
know about your amazing...

239
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:06,460
compression rate, but
let's not be naive here.

240
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:10,090
You can't expect to just
throw money at an algorithm

241
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,530
and beat one of the largest
tech companies in the world,

242
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,660
so why don't you rework this a little

243
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,770
and come back in with a little more?

244
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,730
Maybe next week?

245
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:25,300
- And?
- That was really weird.

246
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:28,670
I guess we don't have as much
Elvis dust on us as I thought.

247
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:31,110
You see? This is why I wanted
to go with Peter Gregory.

248
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:34,150
This is bullshit. That guy
throws this huge party for us

249
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,950
and then acts like he doesn't even want us?

250
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,850
I fucking hate parties. And he's just,
"Come back next week when you have more."

251
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,750
More? More than 5.2 on Weissman?

252
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:44,080
No. No.

253
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,980
Fuck that guy. Fuck this
place. Fuck this whole place.

254
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,320
- Watch me fuck this place.
- No, wait! Wait, wait!

255
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:55,360
Hey. Remember when you told me
to come back when I had more?

256
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:58,090
And then I said I would?
Well, I'm not going to.

257
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,390
Ever. This doesn't count.

258
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:03,270
I'm covered in dust. I'm a three-foot dick,

259
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,730
and I've got half an ass
to go to some other company

260
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:09,080
who's never gonna put me on a
Jumbotron or throw balls at me.

261
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,680
Bye.

262
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,620
Are you feeling unwell? Do you need protein?

263
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:24,920
I don't know what happened.

264
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,520
Between Peter dying and
Raviga maybe being gone,

265
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,630
I just... I just wanna get
funded and build Pied Piper.

266
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,030
I hate this part.

267
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,730
Well, if one thing is for sure...

268
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:37,640
if we're gonna get any traction,
I need to step up my game.

269
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,940
It's an email from Ron LaFlamme.

270
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,680
"Just got a term sheet from Stern-Taylor.

271
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:45,340
"They offered five million

272
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:48,040
"at 25 million post-money valuation.

273
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:50,740
- "More than I thought."
- Shit. They were negging us.

274
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,880
- Negging?
- Negging is going negative.

275
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:56,410
It's a manipulative sex strategy
used by lonely chauvinists.

276
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,920
See, everybody wants us.
By shitting all over us,

277
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:01,390
they try and bring our price down,

278
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,790
but you shitting all over them

279
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,120
counteracted them shitting all over us.

280
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,800
You negged a neg. Richard,
this could be good.

281
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:11,660
Where do we have next? Ross-Loma Capital.

282
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:13,430
Should I keep doing it?
Should I keep negging?

283
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,900
No, no, I'll handle this.

284
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,730
If they want to negotiate
using hostility and rudeness...

285
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:20,570
well, they picked the wrong guy.

286
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:24,220
Well, you see, our main concern

287
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,380
is how you're going to achieve escape
velocity on your growth rate...

288
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,950
hit critical mass.

289
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,920
I'm sorry. What... What's funny?

290
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:35,280
It's just that painting behind you.

291
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,950
It's awful.

292
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:41,090
It looks like harlequin
Kama Sutra done poorly.

293
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,630
So, I agree,

294
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,390
bad culture fit.

295
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:49,070
- I think we all just move on.
- Look, I didn't say anything about a culture fit.

296
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,840
No, I did.

297
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:53,610
Okay. Well...

298
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,310
thank you for meeting with us.

299
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,420
We have a bunch of these things to go to,

300
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,550
hopefully with more tasteful artwork,

301
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:03,390
and your logo looks like a sideways vagina.

302
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,120
I find that to be racist, don't you?

303
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,260
Okay, here's my concern...
Here's my concern...

304
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,890
Who the hell picked out that shirt for you?

305
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,800
- What?
- Oh, I see.

306
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:20,800
With the pants, so I guess it's a whole...

307
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,370
- thing.
- My wife picked these out.

308
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:24,940
Then you married poorly.

309
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:28,340
Do you care about Pied Piper?

310
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,250
Do I care about Pied Piper? Well, of course.

311
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,680
'Cause if you do, I'm not seeing it.

312
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,250
In fact, what I think I'm
seeing is the human equivalent

313
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:38,790
of a "flassid" penis.

314
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,300
"Flak-sid." It's actually
pronounced "flak-sid."

315
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,790
Not a lot of people know that.

316
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:45,630
Well, we are definitely interested,

317
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:48,230
but I think we need to...

318
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,770
I'm sorry. Is something wrong?

319
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,330
No, this is... all wrong.

320
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:56,500
I am sensing a general lack of vision.

321
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,880
Your muffins smell like shit.

322
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,570
So do your ideas.

323
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:04,180
One of you is the least
attractive person I've ever seen,

324
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,080
and I'm not gonna say who.

325
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,820
Should we leave or should you?

326
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,990
We just got offered eight at 40.

327
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,930
We're five for five, gentlemen.

328
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,600
And Galveston Capital Fund and
Yountville Ventures called.

329
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,770
They want to move their meetings
up before everyone else.

330
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:22,470
Hey, let me try. I want to
be rude at this next one.

331
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,880
Go for it.

332
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,510
So, with some proper funding,

333
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:28,550
we should be able to get a
functioning beta in time for CES.

334
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,150
And if you don't fund us,

335
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,350
you're a fucking slut.

336
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,390
Ah. What's that smell?

337
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:42,560
Is that a fart? You... Are you a farter?

338
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:48,000
Now, can I have a pastry? Or
are you guys gonna eat 'em all?

339
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,240
'Cause you're gonna get fat.

340
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,520
It's not your fault, Richard. This is
just something that can't be taught,

341
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:01,420
so leave the next one to me. I
can feel a big one coming on.

342
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:05,120
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm not sure yet, but give me room.

343
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,790
There's something inside
of me that has to come out,

344
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,520
and who am I to stop it?

345
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,030
His balls?

346
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:15,300
He put his balls on the table?

347
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,630
- Right on the table.
- On purpose?

348
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:20,170
I don't see how it could be by accident.

349
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,410
Richard, I just got an email
from the guys at Midland-Oak.

350
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,920
Apparently, there is a
line, and I crossed it...

351
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:30,580
The line between $12 and $15 million!

352
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:33,820
Ba-bam! Midland-Oak's offer just came in.

353
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:38,320
Gentlemen, we are valued at
75 million, fully diluted.

354
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:41,090
- Are you shitting me?
- Take a look at these term sheets.

355
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,100
There is a linear correlation
between how intolerable I was

356
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,990
and the height of valuation.

357
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:51,670
Hey, you guys. This is Laurie Bream,

358
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,670
the new managing partner at Raviga.

359
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:56,310
Hi. I'm Richard Hendricks.

360
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,380
Yes. I recognize you from your photograph.

361
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:01,380
It's very nice to meet you in person.

362
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,550
- Yeah.
- Okay, so we did that.

363
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,850
Gentlemen, I am aware of
the degree of interest

364
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,320
you are receiving from other firms.

365
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,960
I am aware that participation
in your Series A will require

366
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:12,920
a very competitive offer,
but for numerous reasons,

367
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,430
I believe it to be the prudent decision.

368
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,660
Now I am

369
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,470
presenting you with this.

370
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,740
20 million at $100 million valuation?

371
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:28,270
- I don't, uh...
- This is way more than any other offer.

372
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:32,010
Correct. That is very much intentional.

373
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,510
So, I believe that
satisfies your requirements?

374
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:37,650
Monica will arrange a time
to formalize the details.

375
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,320
Thank you. Have a good day.

376
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:41,090
Uh, thank you.

377
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,780
Yes.

378
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:46,620
Yes.

379
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:50,020
Congratulations, guys. I am so glad...

380
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:52,530
Oh, shit. She's my ride home.

381
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,890
- I'll call you, Richard.
- Yeah, okay.

382
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,870
Wait! Laurie, hold on! Thanks for stopping...

383
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,870
Guys, I think we're funded.

384
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,410
- Yes! Richie!
- Oh, yeah!

385
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,880
Erlich: So, I push my dick to the
side, unbutton the bottom buttons,

386
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,290
and bam!

387
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,950
- Ah! What are you doing?
- Shit. Sorry, sorry. Sorry.

388
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:20,790
Meet me on the side of the house.

389
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,990
- I... okay.
- Okay. Go.

390
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,000
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

391
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:29,730
If anyone finds out that I came
back here, I will get fired, okay?

392
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,070
Okay.

393
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,030
- Don't take this deal.
- What?

394
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:36,830
You are worth half that at best.

395
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:39,330
Oh. Wow. Thanks for the compliment.

396
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:42,130
No. The credit to you guys.
You negotiated your asses off,

397
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,540
but this is a classic runaway valuation.

398
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,810
What's wrong with that?

399
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:49,850
Pied Piper will be tied
to this crazy valuation

400
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,210
that you will never be able to live up to.

401
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:56,020
If you don't keep increasing
in value in the next round,

402
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,460
if you have a down round, you are fucked.

403
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,160
It is the kiss of death for a young CEO.

404
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:03,490
You want to start with a realistic valuation

405
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,200
and grow at a reasonable pace.

406
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,890
Okay, well, if it's such a shitty deal,

407
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,900
then why did your boss offer it to us?

408
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,870
Because she's as competitive as hell.

409
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,170
She needs Pied Piper to
keep Raviga afloat, Richard.

410
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,110
- Okay.
- Look, I respect Laurie,

411
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:20,000
but this is the exact type
of thing Peter never did.

412
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,240
Richard, come on. I own shares in Pied Piper.

413
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:25,070
If this high a valuation
was good in the long-term,

414
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:28,340
would I be standing here, risking my job?

415
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:32,110
Don't take our offer. Maybe go
with the lowest offer you got.

416
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,610
Even that might be too high.

417
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,710
Again, thank you for the compliment.

418
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,720
Also... I didn't see anything

419
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,480
- in there.
- No. Yeah, thank you.

420
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,360
I was gonna say if you had,
you'd have to show me yours, too.

421
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,590
Umm...

422
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,690
- Okay.
- Okay. Thanks for the...

423
00:22:02,341 --> 00:22:06,262
_

424
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:11,240
Yeah, sorry about that party.

425
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,950
I was in kind of a bad way that night.

426
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:17,310
And truth is... I'm actually doing okay.

427
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,480
- Good. That's great.
- Yeah.

428
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,950
I mean, I could run the scenarios
about what happened all I want,

429
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:25,089
but... I finally just
realized there's just nothing

430
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:26,724
- I could do, you know?
- Yeah. but... I finally just realized there's just nothing

431
00:22:26,725 --> 00:22:28,130
- I could do, you know?
- Yeah.

432
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,660
So... I'm at peace with it all.

433
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:33,890
I was thinking, actually...

434
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:37,100
What if you had asked for less?

435
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:41,760
- What?
- Well, what if you could've gone to someone

436
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:44,100
and asked for less than what
they offered that first round?

437
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,940
You mean, like, negotiating them down?

438
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:49,010
- Yeah.
- Can... Can you even do that?

439
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,610
- Well, yeah. I mean, why not?
- Yeah, but...

440
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:57,070
I mean, I guess, technically, I could have...

441
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:59,440
- Mmm.
- Huh.

442
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,510
Yeah, I suppose you could argue
that it might've been easier

443
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:07,050
to hit more realistic benchmarks

444
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,180
- and reach cash flow break-even.
- Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

445
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:13,320
And then...

446
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,680
we wouldn't have faced that down round...

447
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:20,460
and... we...

448
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:22,920
wouldn't have had to settle for acquisition.

449
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:26,590
All that money...

450
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:29,430
- fucked me.
- Wow. I mean, I don't know about...

451
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,290
- Shit!
- Maybe.

452
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:35,140
- Look... Hey.
- No, no, no. We could've done a legit Series B.

453
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:37,240
Right? I'd still be CEO.

454
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:39,640
I'd have my job,

455
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:41,240
my kick-ass house.

456
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:43,310
I'd probably still have my girlfriend...

457
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,480
and...

458
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:48,010
- Fuck!
- Okay.

459
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:51,720
Why the fuck didn't anyone
tell me I could take less?

460
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,680
I don't know. I don't know.

461
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,450
- Ideas come up and then...
- Fuck!

462
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:59,980
I'll take a cab, so I'll leave you to it.

463
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,450
Thanks for meeting me.

464
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:03,820
Fuck!

465
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,560
Richard.

466
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:15,660
Richard, I'm Laurie Bream. I
was inside your home yesterday.

467
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,430
Have you made a decision
regarding our proposal?

468
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:19,940
Uh, yeah, yeah, we'll go with you guys,

469
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:22,500
but we need to renegotiate the terms.

470
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,100
Oh, I'm afraid that's untenable.

471
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,640
We're offering as much money as we can.

472
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:28,140
No, no, we wanna go lower. We want less...

473
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,980
A lot less, actually.

474
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,780
We'll go with Raviga if you guys do

475
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,150
10 million at a 50 million valuation,

476
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,680
not 20 at 100.

477
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,980
I think this is more reasonable,

478
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:42,390
and it's my final offer. Take it or leave it.

479
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,920
I was not anticipating this,

480
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:48,030
but I think it will be workable from our end.

481
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:51,970
And one more thing... Monica
votes for Raviga's board seat.

482
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:55,470
Certainly that seems unimportant.

483
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,670
I will telephone your lawyer tomorrow,

484
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:00,610
- and we can speak about the relevant details.
- Good.

485
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,780
Peter was one of the few
who genuinely took action

486
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:16,010
to use technology to help humanity thrive.

487
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:18,050
But how exactly can we quantify

488
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:21,950
another human's contributions to mankind?

489
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:25,420
Let's break it down into its
three component elements.

490
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:34,630
I met Peter when he was thinking about
investing in my company, Zetasphere,

491
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:39,240
although I think he was hesitant after his
disappointing initial return from Snapchat.

492
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:44,010
He came on board, anyway, and
every month we would meet.

493
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:45,780
Peter was always an honest man,

494
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,950
and I know that if Peter
were here with us today,

495
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:50,980
he would say that he was not
disappointed in Snapchat,

496
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:54,420
and he would forgive you, Lev,
for your misunderstanding.

497
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:57,250
That's just the kind of guy that Peter was...

498
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:59,620
Warm, generous,

499
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,090
and not disappointed in Snapchat.

500
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:12,460
I'll never forget the first time I met Peter.

501
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:14,630
It was in his mom's garage,

502
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:16,300
where we started our
first business together...

503
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:19,540
Manufacturing VGA graphics
cards for IBM clones.

504
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,970
We never looked back.

505
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,600
And you know, the last time I saw him,

506
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,870
it was at a restaurant, not a
half-mile away from that same garage.

507
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:28,710
We talked as old friends do.

508
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,410
He asked me about Jackson Hole,

509
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:34,350
I asked him about... Pilates.

510
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:38,160
And yet... something was wrong.

511
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:42,120
Underneath it all, there
was an unmistakable tension.

512
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,190
A tension I will forever regret.

513
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:48,500
It's no secret Peter and
I had our differences.

514
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:50,930
We let business get between us.

515
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:52,470
Now?

516
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,070
Now I wish I could say I'm sorry for that.

517
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:57,570
It's too late. He's gone,

518
00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:01,780
and it makes me realize the
importance of forgiveness,

519
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:05,310
of doing things with love
and compassion in your heart,

520
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:08,020
and not vengeance and competition.

521
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,690
I mean, we owe that to each other, don't we?

522
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,620
And to him?

523
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:17,390
After all, this valley is the
place Peter himself helped build.

524
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:20,520
Where we come together as dreamers,

525
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:24,800
all of us, to truly make
the world a better place.

526
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:28,900
This is Florence during the Renaissance.

527
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:31,200
This is Camelot.

528
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:35,680
This is the place Peter himself
called "the cradle of innovation."

529
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,210
I will miss my friend.

530
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:45,420
Bye, Pete.

531
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,690
Maybe he is a human, after all.

532
00:27:54,746 --> 00:27:56,059
Sorry.

533
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:59,459
It's from Ron LaFlamme.

534
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,259
Gavin Belson is suing you.

535
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:04,020
"Filed claims today that you
stole Pied Piper from Hooli."

536
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,860
Shit.

537
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:15,230
Gavin Belson is suing us.

538
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,830
